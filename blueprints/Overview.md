# Activiti Cloud blueprints
Activiti Cloud BluePrints are intended to serve as examples on how to implement Cloud Native Applications. These examples are built using Activiti Cloud Components, but might be used to demonstrate other Cloud Native components as well.
Most of these BluePrints are built to be deployed in distributed infrastructures such as Kubernetes & Docker.
Each of the components included in these BluePrints tries to be single focused and as small as possible and depending on your requirements some of the components used in these BluePrints can be turned off.
